# Giphy

Get the URL for a random gif from [Giphy](https://giphy.com/) based on a search query:

```shell
giphy "old white guy dabbing"
giphy "sadness"
giphy "that one with the pitbull waddling down the stairs"
```

## Usage

You will need an API key from [Giphy](https://developers.giphy.com/). Create a
file called `~/.giphy` and fill it with your API key:

```shell
echo 'api_key = "YOUR_KEY_HERE"' > ~/.giphy
```

Now search for gifs:

```shell
giphy "search query goes here"
```

PROTIP: Pipe that üî• straight to `pbcopy` and paste into your favourite ~colleague harassment~ intra-office communication tool:

```shell
giphy "why the hell would you commit that??" | pbcopy
```

Alternatively you can be basic and just get a random trending gif:

```shell
giphy
```

### Options

* `--amount <AMOUNT>` how many gifs to retrieve
* `--apikey <KEY>` specify the API key
* `--help` Show help text
* `--markdown` Wrap the URL in some markdown - useful for saying üëç to pull requests
* `--rating <RATING>` specify the rating of the gif (based on the [rating list](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/optional-settings/#rating))

### Config File

The config file `.giphy` must be placed in your home directory and can contain
the following:

* `api_key` Your API KEY
* `markdown` Whether to wrap the URL in markdown

Look at the `example_config.toml` file to see an example of how to use it.
